In these Initial versions I was using the "trainNetwork" function to train my network and when I was computing the Jacobian, 
I was mistakenly using the "dlnet" object which was a un-trained network which only has the structure of my desired network but 
not the trained weights. So in the next versions, I used the "dlnet" object and wrote a training function to train the network and
then use it to compute the Jacobian.
